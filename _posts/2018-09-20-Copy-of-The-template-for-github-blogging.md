    <td>I could have possibly searched for options as of what to do when I was stuck where as I normally was just sticking with working it out myself, then I went straight towards asking my partner (next to me) and other people that were further ahead than me that were also around me.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning for next time, I must need to be able to be ahead of other people that are doing the work that are around me which is most of the room however there is one or two people that are very far ahead and so doing it quicker than the teacher is explaining to us and has at least got one or two steps ahead of the rest of the class. I also could have talked a bit less. This limits my learning as I am not concentrating as much as I possibly could be.</td>
