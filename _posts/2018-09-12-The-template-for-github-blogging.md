    <td>Next time, I will not need to take much time whilst opening up my computer and all the tabs that I need open will  not take as much time as I now know what I need open and so it won't take as much time. We also have some school resources on the school website that are easy to follow. Adding to this, from previous years we have taken in a lot of knowledge. This includes a google classroom that contains some helpful information like what you need to create tables etc. </td>
